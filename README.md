# Home Automation API

A collection of my private API endpoints to control my home. As this is so unique to my home, this is not designed to 
be a re-usable product. This is open sourced purely so that others might take inspiration or knowledge for their projects.

*API endpoints:*
- Turn on/off RF controlled lights
- Turn off an LG WebOS smart TV
